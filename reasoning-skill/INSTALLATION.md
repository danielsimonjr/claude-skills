## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Claude isn't using the bias system"

**Solutions**:
- Explicitly mention "use bias-aware reasoning" in your prompt
- Reference specific components: "Apply the pre-decision checklist"
- Ask: "What biases might affect this decision?"
- Request: "Use pre-mortem analysis"

### "Too much overhead for simple tasks"

**Solutions**:
- Use quick pre-decision checklist (10 items) from README
- Focus on top 3-5 biases most relevant to your domain
- Apply one debiasing technique per major decision
- Scale depth to decision importance

### "Not sure which bias applies"

**Solutions**:
- Use bias identification flowchart in cognitive_bias_checklist.md
- Check domain_mappings.md for your field's common biases
- Review debiasing_examples.md for similar situations
- Start with top 10 biases (most common)

### "Debiasing techniques aren't working"

**Solutions**:
- Ensure you're applying them before the decision
- Use forcing functions (checklists, protocols), not just awareness
- Get external input (red team, devil's advocate)
- Build institutional processes, don't rely on willpower
- Track calibration to measure actual improvement

## 🌟 Advanced Features (v4.0)
