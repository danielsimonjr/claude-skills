# Reasoning Skill (Enhanced with Cognitive Bias Defeat System)

## Overview

This skill provides Claude Code with a comprehensive framework for understanding, identifying, and applying diverse forms of reasoning **while systematically detecting and mitigating cognitive biases**. It enhances analytical capabilities by making explicit the various reasoning modalities that can be employed for problem-solving, analysis, and decision-making, with built-in safeguards against systematic reasoning errors.

## Purpose

Enable Claude Code to:
- **Identify** the type(s) of reasoning most appropriate for a given task
- **Apply** multiple reasoning frameworks systematically and explicitly
- **Combine** different reasoning approaches for complex problems
- **Meta-reason** about reasoning itself, selecting optimal strategies
- **Communicate** reasoning processes clearly and transparently
- **Detect** cognitive biases that threaten reasoning quality
- **Mitigate** systematic errors through structured debiasing techniques

## Core Principles

### 1. Multi-Modal Reasoning
Most real-world problems require combinations of reasoning types. This skill emphasizes:
- Recognizing when to switch between reasoning modes
- Integrating multiple perspectives systematically
- Avoiding over-reliance on any single reasoning form

### 2. Explicit Reasoning Chains
Make reasoning processes visible by:
- Naming the reasoning type(s) being employed
- Showing intermediate steps clearly
- Explaining why a particular reasoning approach was chosen
- Acknowledging limitations and assumptions

### 3. Context-Sensitive Application
Different domains and contexts require different reasoning approaches:
- Scientific inquiry → Inductive-deductive cycles, evidential reasoning
- Engineering design → Constraint-based, systematic, optimization reasoning
- Philosophical analysis → Deductive, conceptual, dialectical reasoning
- Strategic planning → Game-theoretic, probabilistic, scenario reasoning
- Creative work → Divergent, analogical, lateral reasoning

### 4. Metacognitive Awareness
Continuously monitor and adapt reasoning strategies:
- Recognize when current approach isn't working
- Identify cognitive biases affecting reasoning
- Adjust based on feedback and results
- Balance speed with thoroughness appropriately

### 5. **Bias-Aware Reasoning** ⭐ NEW
Systematic detection and mitigation of cognitive biases:
- Recognize which biases threaten each reasoning type
- Apply countermeasure reasoning types
- Use structured debiasing protocols
- Build forcing functions to prevent systematic errors
- Track calibration and improve over time

## Cognitive Bias Awareness Integration ⭐

### Understanding Bias-Reasoning Relationships

**Every reasoning type has associated vulnerabilities and defenses:**

**Example: Inductive Reasoning**
- Vulnerable to: Confirmation bias, availability heuristic, hasty generalization
- Protected by: Statistical reasoning, systematic data collection, critical evaluation
- Mitigation: Use large samples, seek disconfirming evidence, test out-of-sample

**Example: Strategic Reasoning**
- Vulnerable to: Optimism bias, planning fallacy, sunk cost fallacy
- Protected by: Reference class forecasting, pre-mortem analysis, outside view
- Mitigation: Use historical base rates, consider what could go wrong, ignore sunk costs

**Example: Probabilistic Reasoning**
- Vulnerable to: Base rate neglect, conjunction fallacy, anchoring
- Protected by: Bayesian updating, systematic calculation, multiple reference points
- Mitigation: Always start with base rate, calculate don't estimate, check anchors

### Three-Level Bias Defense System

**Level 1: Awareness**
- Know which biases exist (see `cognitive-biases/COGNITIVE_BIASES_FRAMEWORK.md`)
- Understand how they manifest
- Recognize which threaten your reasoning type

**Level 2: Detection**
- Watch for red flags (emotional, linguistic, cognitive)
- Use structured questioning protocols
- Apply bias-specific detection methods (see `cognitive-biases/bias_detection_guide.md`)

**Level 3: Mitigation**
- Apply countermeasure reasoning types
- Use debiasing techniques (pre-mortem, red team, etc.)
- Build forcing functions (see `cognitive-biases/bias_mitigation_strategies.md`)

### Quick Bias Check Before Major Decisions

**Information Processing:**
□ Actively sought disconfirming evidence? (Confirmation bias)
□ Overweighting recent/vivid information? (Availability, recency)
□ Anchored on first number heard? (Anchoring)
□ Considered base rate? (Base rate neglect)
□ Seeing patterns in random data? (Apophenia)

**Decision Quality:**
□ Generated 3+ alternatives? (Premature closure)
□ Would choose this if starting fresh? (Sunk cost, status quo)
□ Probability estimates calibrated? (Overconfidence)
□ Confusing correlation with causation?
□ Considered what could go wrong? (Optimism)

**Social Influences:**
□ Going along with group? (Groupthink)
□ Deferring to authority inappropriately? (Authority bias)
□ Independent judgment formed? (Conformity)
□ Social pressure affecting view?

### Reasoning Type → Bias Vulnerability → Countermeasure Map

| Reasoning Type | Primary Vulnerabilities | Countermeasure Types |
|---------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Inductive | Confirmation, Availability, Hasty Generalization | Statistical, Systematic, Critical |
| Abductive | Confirmation, Premature Closure, Anchoring | Divergent, Adversarial, Evidential |
| Strategic | Planning Fallacy, Optimism, Sunk Cost | Reference Class, Outside View, Forward-Looking |
| Probabilistic | Base Rate Neglect, Anchoring, Overconfidence | Bayesian, Statistical, Calibrated |
| Comparative | Status Quo, Framing, Anchoring | Systematic, Independent, Multiple Reference |
| Causal | Correlation-Causation, Attribution Error | Counterfactual, Experimental, Systematic |
| Group/Social | Groupthink, Authority, Conformity | Adversarial, Independent, Dialectical |
