## 🔑 Key Innovations

### 1. Bidirectional Reasoning-Bias Mapping

**Every bias is linked to:**
- Which reasoning types it affects (vulnerabilities)
- Which reasoning types counter it (defenses)

**Example:**
```
Confirmation Bias
├─ Vulnerable: Inductive, Abductive, Analogical
└─ Defeats: Critical, Adversarial, Dialectical, Evidential, Meta-reasoning

Availability Heuristic
├─ Vulnerable: Inductive, Probabilistic, Case-based
└─ Defeats: Statistical, Systematic, Quantitative, Bayesian

Anchoring Bias
├─ Vulnerable: Quantitative, Comparative, Estimative
└─ Defeats: Multiple Reference Points, Independent, Systematic
```

This creates a **practical defense system**: know which biases threaten your reasoning type, apply countermeasure reasoning types.
